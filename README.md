### This project implements a cloud-native microservices architecture using Spring Boot and Spring Cloud components. It features centralized configuration management with Spring Cloud Config, dynamic service discovery via Eureka Server, and load balancing through Spring Cloud Load Balancer. Resilience is ensured with circuit breakers (Hystrix or Resilience4j), and system health is monitored using Spring Actuator. Feign clients simplify inter-service communication, while an API Gateway manages request routing and common concerns like security. Together, these components provide a scalable, fault-tolerant, and maintainable microservices solution for cloud environments.
